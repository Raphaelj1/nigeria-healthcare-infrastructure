					<h3>Mapping Nigeria’s Healthcare: Addressing Gaps, Unlocking Opportunities</h3>
					<p>
						Our team’s focus area for the 2024 Digital Nigeria Innovation Challenge is
						healthcare infrastructure. With a rapidly growing population and varying
						access to healthcare services across Nigeria, we aim to provide a
						comprehensive view of healthcare infrastructure to support data-driven
						decisions in addressing gaps and promoting equitable access to healthcare
						for all Nigerians.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-section">
					<h3>The Story Behind the Data</h3>
					<p>
						Healthcare is an essential pillar of human development, and ensuring access
						to quality care is crucial for Nigeria’s future prosperity. However, our map
						reveals stark disparities across the nation. Using reliable, up-to-date
						data, we have mapped all healthcare facilities across Nigeria’s 36 states,
						offering insights into facility functionality and regional distribution.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-section">
					<h3>Data Sources</h3>
					<p>
						To ensure the accuracy of our healthcare data, we sourced our information
						from the
						<a href="https://hfr.health.gov.ng/facilities/hospitals-list"
							>Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health</a
						>, which provides detailed reports on healthcare facilities across the
						country. Population estimate and projection data which is critical to
						understanding the infrastructure needs in different regions, was gathered
						from the National Population Commission of Nigeria and the National Bureau
						of Statistics
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-section">
					<h3>Key Indicators for State Layer</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Estimated Population:</strong>
								This figure indicates the total number of residents, providing
								insight into the community size and demographics.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Population Density (per km²):</strong>This metric reveals
								the number of individuals living in each square kilometre,
								highlighting population concentration and potential impacts on local
								resources and services.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Geopolitical Region:</strong>The state is situated in a
								specific region of Nigeria, which is essential for understanding its
								political, cultural, and socioeconomic context.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Total Facilities:</strong>This represents the overall number
								of healthcare facilities, offering an overview of the healthcare
								infrastructure and accessibility for residents.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Functional Facilities:</strong>This number indicates how
								many healthcare facilities are fully operational and capable of
								providing medical services, reflecting the effectiveness of the
								healthcare system.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Partially Functional Facilities:</strong>This metric
								highlights the number of facilities that offer limited services,
								pointing to areas that may require improvements or additional
								resources.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Non-functional Facilities:</strong>This figure shows the
								number of healthcare facilities that are completely inactive,
								raising concerns about the availability of healthcare services.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>

							<p>
								One of the key features of the State layer on our map is the
								integration of population density data for each state, which helps
								illustrate the relationship between population concentration and
								healthcare availability. For each state, our map highlights:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										The <strong>total number of healthcare facilities,</strong>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The number of
										<strong
											>functional, partially functional, and non-functional
											facilities,</strong
										>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The number of facilities with an
										<strong>unknown status</strong>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This combination of indicators offers a holistic view of healthcare
								demand. For example, a state with a high population density but a
								low number of functional facilities would face significant
								challenges in meeting its population’s healthcare needs, while
								states with a greater percentage of unknown or non-functional
								facilities may require immediate intervention to improve healthcare
								access.
